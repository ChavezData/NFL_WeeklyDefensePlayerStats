# NFL Weekly Defensive Player Stats

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that compiles, analyzes, and visualizes **weekly defensive player statistics** in the NFL. The goal is to provide an accessible, reproducible pipeline for gathering and interpreting defensive performance metrics across the season.

## Motivation

- Defensive stats in the NFL are widely available, but aggregating them week-by-week for each player (and then analyzing trends) can involve a lot of tedious data engineering.
- This project aims to encapsulate the ETL (extract, transform, load) steps along with basic visualization and analysis in a clean, documented form.
- It can serve as a foundation for fantasy football tools, research, portfolio modeling, or advanced analytics.

## Features

- Automated fetching / ingestion of weekly defensive player stats  
- Data cleaning, normalization, and aggregation  
- Visualizations of trends (e.g. per-game rates, cumulative stats)  
- Flexibility in filtering by position, team, date, etc.  
- Exportable outputs (CSV, plots, etc.)

## Data Sources

*(Modify this section to reflect exactly the sources used in the notebook)*

- Official NFL stats API or CSV dumps  
- Third-party sources (e.g. Pro Football Reference, FantasyData, or similar)  
- Any local or cached datasets used in preprocessing

## Installation / Requirements

1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChavezData/NFL_WeeklyDefensePlayerStats.git
   cd NFL_WeeklyDefensePlayerStats

	2.	(Recommended) Create a Python virtual environment

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


	3.	Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


	4.	Launch Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook



Example requirements.txt

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
requests
jupyter

(Add any other packages your notebook uses, e.g. scipy, plotly, etc.)

Usage
	1.	Open NFL_Weekly_Player_Defensive_Stats.ipynb in Jupyter.
	2.	Run the notebook from top to bottom (or in sections) to fetch, transform, and analyze the data.
	3.	Modify parameters (e.g. year, weeks included, filters) near the top to customize your run.
	4.	Save or export results (CSV, PNG, etc.) for further use.

Example flow
	•	Specify the season (e.g. 2024) and weeks
	•	Fetch raw data from source
	•	Apply cleaning (missing data handling, type conversion)
	•	Compute derived stats (e.g. per-game averages, normalized metrics)
	•	Plot trends or comparisons across players / teams
	•	Export final dataset for downstream modeling

Notebook Structure

Here’s a high-level breakdown of the notebook’s sections:

Section	Purpose
Setup & imports	Load required Python packages
Configuration / parameters	Define constants (season, weeks, API endpoints)
Data ingestion	Pull raw defensive stats from sources
Data cleaning & preprocessing	Wrap missing values, data types, merging
Feature engineering	Create derived statistics (rates, per-game, normalized)
Exploratory analysis	Visualize trends, compare players / teams
Output / export	Save cleaned data or generate report

Customization

You can adapt or extend this project in multiple ways:
	•	Add new metrics: e.g. tackle efficiency, pressure rates, fantasy scoring.
	•	Extend to offense / special teams: replicate pattern for offensive players.
	•	Automate scheduling: run weekly and append new data automatically.
	•	Dashboard / dashboarding: integrate with Streamlit, Dash, or Power BI for interactive use.
	•	Modeling / prediction: feed the resulting dataset into machine learning models for defensive performance forecasting.

Contributing

Contributions, suggestions, and bug reports are very welcome!

If you make improvements (e.g. more robust data fetching, caching, error handling, new metrics), please submit a Pull Request. Try to follow the existing coding style and add documentation / comments for new code.
